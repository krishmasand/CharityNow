# CharityNow
Android app for both charity organizations and individuals.

CharityNow lets charity organizations find real-time popular venues to advertise and make their presence known based on population data provided by HERE's traffic API (the more popular a place at a given time, the more highly it is recommended). Organizations can check into a place through CharityNow as well, and this will alert individual users of the app.

Individuals that use CharityNow can identify charity organizations that have checked in at a nearby location. This is primarily for the user to have the ability to talk to a checked in charity and learn more about the organization. The user then has the ability to donate to said charity through CharityNow, which takes advantage of SendGrid's Java Library and Venmo's API.
